**TextInsight** is a lightweight NLP document exploration tool that enables topic discovery, keyword extraction, and sentiment analysis from unstructured text without requiring labelled data. The app allows users to upload a `.txt` file containing multiple documents, automatically cleans and preprocesses the text, generates TF-IDF embeddings, clusters documents using K-Means, extracts top keywords for each topic, and computes sentiment scores using NLTK VADER. A clean Streamlit interface displays cluster distribution, average sentiment, and a searchable document table, with an option to download the full analysis as CSV—making it an ideal project for quick text analytics, research exploration, and showcasing practical NLP skills.
